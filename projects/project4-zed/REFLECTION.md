What did you build and why?
I decided to build a personalized music recommendation tool that allows users to create custom playlists based on their mood, genre preferences, and listening history. Based on some research and the creation of a JSON file, I imported about 100 pre-loaded songs into the site that users could use as a baseline for building their playlists. Additionally, my app has a feature that lets users upload their own songs and attach the mood and genre associated with each song. My app also provides song recommendations to add to their tailored playlists, based on similarities in mood, genre, artist, or listening history. When I first read the instructions for this assignment, the idea of building a music playlist tool was the first thing that caught my eye on the list of possible ideas. As I mentioned in my portfolio, I have a strong passion for music and experience working in the data side of the music industry. It is a dream of mine to pursue a career in this industry, and showcasing my passion for it in every project I take on motivates me to learn more about how I can integrate my education into a career. Although this app is very bare-bones, I’m impressed with my ability to bring my ideas to life and proud of myself for working hard on this final project. 

What skills from Projects 1-3 did you upskill? How?
I ultimately upskilled in many areas from my past projects to complete my final project. I primarily focused on perfecting HTML structure and semantic markup, while keeping my CSS styling up to date as I made edits to other sections of my app. By concentrating on HTML layouts, I improved my ability to build well-structured, semantic HTML. Keeping my code organized and clear helped ease my anxieties when shifting between various folders and file types. I’ve become more confident in using meaningful tags like section, article, nav, and header, and in adapting readability and accessibility features. 
In my CSS upskilling, I strengthened my understanding of flexbox and grid by designing my portfolio and the dashboard layouts for project 3. Learning to use reusable CSS variables, like :root, to maintain consistent color themes has made my life a lot easier. Through troubleshooting and collaboration with my JS files, I was able to fix problems on my own, including adjusting layout sizes for various screens and ensuring my night mode works across all devices. 
	Although this was one of the first skills we learned as a class, I really got the basis down of importing images and making sure they displayed correctly across all devices. I struggled significantly with importing a PDF when I tried to add my resume to my Project 1 portfolio, so learning how to troubleshoot and convert my PDF to a JPEG for successful upload was a turning point in my project development. I developed a more substantial knowledge of JS syntax, its functions, and the purpose of having event listeners in building an interactive project. I gained experience in manipulating the DOM to update UI elements quickly. From my Local Favorites Tracker project, I learned how to store, retrieve, and update data using localStorage. Project 3 taught me to upskill my Project Zed by integrating custom JSON files and datapoints, fetching data from external sources, and handling asynchronous data while updating my UI with real-time, up-to-date data. My biggest accomplishment is learning to debug my console throughout my project consistently. I hit a lot of roadblocks along the way, but becoming more confident in my debugging capabilities made my project go by smoothly. Altogether, I believe that my Project Zed perfectly encompasses all the skills I’ve become more confident in throughout the semester, as shown in each project I’ve created. 

How did AI change your development process?
AI completely reshaped how I approached building this app by allowing me to plan and structure my work more intentionally. Instead of jumping straight into coding and figuring things out as I went, AI helped me outline the “skeleton” of the project first. This made my workflow more organized and helped me visualize the final product before writing any detailed code.
Early on, tools like Claude Sonnet 4.5 helped me understand best practices in HTML structure – such as using semantic tags, accessibility labeling, and separating major components (header, sidebars, main panels). This guidance allowed me to build a clean foundation, making later steps much easier.
AI accelerated the more technical parts of development as well. When I moved into CSS and JavaScript, it acted like a mentor: helping me understand how responsive layouts work, why media queries behave the way they do, and how to break my JavaScript into logical sections like state.js, ui.js, and recommendations.js.
It didn’t replace the work for me; it made me more confident about doing it myself. Whenever I got stuck with data flow, DOM manipulation, event handling, or localStorage, AI gave explanations that helped me actually understand the underlying logic rather than just copying code. Overall, AI made my development process more efficient, structured, and intentional. It helped me think like a developer instead of someone just trying to patch things together.

What surprised you about working with AI?
What surprised me most was how collaborative the process felt. I expected AI to simply give me answers, but instead, it taught me patterns, explained concepts, and guided me through decisions, making me feel more capable as a developer. I was also surprised by how much AI emphasized good practices, not just working code. It kept suggesting semantic HTML, clear file organization, accessibility labels, and breaking my JavaScript into logical modules. These are things I might not have prioritized on my own at this stage. Another surprising moment was how much AI helped me debug my thinking, not just my code. When my CSS responsiveness or theme toggle wasn’t working the way I expected, AI helped me understand why, instead of just giving me fixes. That changed the way I approach solving problems. I also didn’t expect AI to explain complicated JavaScript ideas (like event listening, when I didn’t know what it was, scoring algorithms, or localStorage syncing) in a way that actually made sense and felt digestible. Overall, I was surprised by how much AI amplified my learning instead of replacing it. It pushed me to think deeper, organize better, and write cleaner code, and that’s something I didn’t expect going into this project.
What would you do differently next time?
If I had more time, I think I would’ve started by doing more research on how to add depth to my suggestions list. Right now, the suggestions list is only associated with the JSON file of the ~100 songs that I manually created. The suggestions list reads the users’ files and relates them to the JSON file, but in the future, I’d love to have this app read new information daily on trending songs and/or user data points. I also think it would be cool to take inspiration from apps like Spotify and Apple Music, which do a great job of integrating AI into their recommendations, allowing users to find new music just from a single listen to a song they like. 

How has your confidence as a developer changed?
Going into this course, I was confident in my very minimal skills with HTML and JS. Working from square 1 really helped me understand the framework around web development as a whole. Learning the ins and outs of each language type and how they interact with one another through our development of various sites, apps, and functions has really stuck with me, especially while creating Project Zed. I understand how each language reads the others, and how all of them work together to create a functioning, dynamic, and interactive app for users to upload data points into. Additionally, since the start of this class, my curiosity about what web development looks like across major websites and apps has skyrocketed. I seem to notice when an image doesn’t display correctly on a web landing page more than I ever did before. The impact of easy-to-read text and color choices has resonated with me a lot, too, after learning more about accessibility points. As a developer, I feel like I have gone from a limited understanding to a basic, grounded approach to building apps and sites for everyone since the start of this class.

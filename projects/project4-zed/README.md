# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Overview
This project is part of my WRIT 40363 course, focusing on upskilling web development techniques through AI collaboration. Project Zed represents the culmination of skills learned across Projects 1-3, enhanced with AI assistance to push beyond my current skill level.

**Project Goal:** [Describe what your app does - e.g., "A personal task manager with calendar integration" or "A habit tracker with streak tracking and charts"]

**Live Demo:** [Your GitHub Pages URL]

## About This Project
Project Zed is about learning and experimentation rather than perfection. This is a completely new web application built from scratch, demonstrating:
- Advanced techniques from earlier course projects
- New skills learned through AI collaboration
- Ambitious feature development with thorough documentation
- Both successes and challenges in the development process

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3** - [Specific techniques: CSS Grid/Flexbox, animations, custom properties, etc.]
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - [Specific patterns: async/await, modules, DOM manipulation, etc.]
- **APIs** - [Any external APIs you're using]
- **AI Tools** - [Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.]

## Features
- [ ] **Feature 1:** [Description]
- [ ] **Feature 2:** [Description]
- [ ] **Feature 3:** [Description]
- [ ] **Feature 4:** [Description]

## Upskilled Techniques
This project demonstrates at least 3 upskilled techniques from the course:

### From Project 1 (HTML/CSS Foundations)
- [e.g., Advanced CSS animations and transitions]
- [e.g., CSS Grid layouts with multiple breakpoints]
- [e.g., Custom CSS properties for theming]

### From Project 2 (JavaScript Fundamentals)
- [e.g., Complex DOM manipulation patterns]
- [e.g., Event delegation and advanced event handling]
- [e.g., Form validation with error handling]

### From Project 3 (APIs & Advanced JS)
- [e.g., Working with external APIs]
- [e.g., Advanced async patterns with Promise.all]
- [e.g., Complex state management]

### New Techniques (Learned via AI)
- [e.g., Modern CSS features like container queries]
- [e.g., Accessibility features with ARIA]
- [e.g., Performance optimization techniques]

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd projects/project4-zed`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or
4. Use a local development server (recommended):

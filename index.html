<p>I am a creative and strategic thinker, with experience in digital marketing, branding, and graphic design. I take pride in representing TCU through The Bob Schieffer College of Communications' student-led advertising agency, Roxo; serving on a specialized team of individuals, reperesenting and maintaining the history, current agency lifestyle, existing/future client connections. As Digital Art Director for the internal communications team, I oversee all creative efforts of other agency members -- adding to my existing list of creative strategy experience I've obtained. Additonally, I represent an events planning company local to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, who's clients and responsibilities consist of wedding and corporate event sponsors. I oversee and manage this company's social media, and create graphic design collateral for clients. Overall, I want to continue to push my creative spark further and apply my knowledge and passion toward a well-faceted portfolio that I can showcase to future employers.</p>

<p>In this course, I'm learning the ins and outs of JavaScript, UX/UI design, and website flow/productivity. I'm interested in growing my skills to produce a streamlined website and portfolio of what I was able to accomplish this semester. </p>

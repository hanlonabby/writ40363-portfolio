#My HW3 Reflection

Confidence check: In all honesty, if the instructions weren't as clear in class, I would definetly be a lot more confused. So far, this is the fastest I've been able to understand a coding structure in all of the coding classes I've taken over the past several semesters. The language makes sense so far, and I'm gaining confidence every class I take!

Learning curve: I think I'm still a bit confused by the process in which to process everything over from one folder to another. I understand why this needs to be done, as a form of extra security in your files, and kind of treating GitHub as a "cloud" to store documents, but I think I could use some more practice with the file.

Problem-solving growth: When I ran into some problems with my code not working at first and not fully understanding the Git transfer process, I asked the peers around me in class for help. It was comforting knowing that we all were on the same page in terms of success or confusion when learning new content. I've also found referring to the instructions for the day on D2L super helpful when I seem stuck on a step in my coding.

Professional Mindset: I think learning more of the semantic growth helped me understand the development of proper coding structures better.

Week 2 Reflection: My biggest "aha" moment has been the understanding and ability to construct the concepts of a very basic webpage, and tweak small things like bolding or italicising specific text. It's cool to see your work actively transform when you click the preview button.

Looking Forward: I think I'm most anxious about not understanding more complex strings of code or structures in the next weeks to come. Its been easy for me to follow along so far and ask for help, so I just hope that this pattern continues.

Support and Resources: I honestly think the structure of the class has been very helpful so far. I enjoy the fact that classmates (including myself) don't feel scared to ask for help or to review a concept. I've been in other coding classes where it feels like I'm the only one who doesn't understand a concept, so moving forward I hope this structure can remain the same.

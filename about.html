     <h2>About Me</h2>

             <!-- the paragraph below includes bold formatting -->

            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur <b>adipisicing elit.</b> Officiis velit totam temporibus aliquid <strong>doloribus facere voluptatum!</strong> Expedita, quasi rerum odit quidem eos reiciendis ducimus explicabo quod? Quaerat amet maiores deleniti?</p>
            
              <p><b>Background</b></p>

            <p>I'm originally from Chicago, where I grew up surrounded with art and design opportunities, granting me a gateway to kickstarting my professional career at TCU. Throughout my time at TCU, I've had the opportunity to lead within different communities and find areas where I thrive creatively. I served as merchandise design chair for my sorority chapter for two years, then leading me to the opportunity of holding the marketing director position on our executive board. Simultaneously, I've held a graphic design internship with a local events design company for two years, and have served in two different creative roles with TCU's student advertising and PR agency, Roxo. For the past two summers, I have served as a marketing intern with a software company in the music industry, located in Chicago. The software, Master Tour by Eventric, serves as a digital tourbook and touring software built for tour managers and artists. This experience has combined my digital marketing skills along with data analytics points that I have learned in the classroom. I've been so grateful for these opportunities thus far, and cannot wait to continue to grow my network and experiences, professionally. As I begin my final year of undergraduate studies, I have goals in expanding my current network, both in and around the music and live events industry. I am mostly interested in pursuing a career in the marketing communications and digital marketing realm, and look forward to the opportunity with presenting my refined skill set and valued education to my future employers.</p>

            <p><b>Education</b></p>

            <p>I'm currently in my final undergraduate year at Texas Christian University, double-majoring in Strategic Communication and Digital Culture/Data Analytics. Through my education, I have learned the ins and outs of marketing, advertising, and public relations communications strategies and channels. Two years ago, I added on a double-major of Digital Culture/Data Analytics, where I've learned how to code, analyze data, and apply Strategic Communication techniques to data-driven information. My education has been directly reflected in my internship experiences, and I look forward to continuing to push myself in the next two semesters to apply what I've learned in the classroom to the real world.</p>


            <p><b>Interests</b></p>
            <p>I'm very interested in digital marketing, digital branding, design, and marekting strategies. My hobbies include spending time with freinds and family, sailing, creating art -- both digital in the form of graphic design, and painting -- and discovering new music. In the past couple of years, I've seen a direct connect between what I like to do for fun and what I want to do with my future, which is motivating and keeps me focused.</p>


            <p><b>Goals</b></p>

            <p>I'm interested in learning more about the process of coding throughout this class. I'm hoping to walk out with basic skills in both frontend and backend development, as I'm familiar with some of the terminology through my time interning at Eventric. Additionally, I'm very interested in UX/UI and am excited to learn more about how this class could strengthen my skills in a future employed role.</p>
